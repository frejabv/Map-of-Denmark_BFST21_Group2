### § 2.1 Workload, work times and groupings
The group will strive to release their work for the week each Friday, beginning the next week’s work immediately after.

The group strives to use approximately 20 hours a week each on the project:	
The group has set Tuesdays and Fridays as the primary work days, where group members are expected to be available and working from 9-16. Within these time periods there will also be approximately 3 hours of meetings. It is expected that each group member uses about 6 hours of their time on the project outside of the primary work days.

The group will hold TA meetings every tuesday, at 14:00 and an internal meeting after, as well as a meeting on fridays.
- TA meetings are meant to help guide the group with the current week’s work.
- Friday meetings are meant for preparing for the next week and releasing the current week's work.

### § 4.1 Goals
The group's goals is to create a project that lives up the requirements listed in the project description. The group has an ambition to deliver a finished and well thought out project, and strives towards a deep understanding of the project's contents.

#### § 4.1.1 The success of the project is based on the final grades of all group members; where similarity is weighted highly. Meaning, if few members get great grades while other group members barely pass, the group failed at becoming a team, and was therefore not successful. 

### § 4.2 Expectations
#### § 4.2.1 When deadlines are set they are expected to be met. Further details on handling deadlines are mentioned in § 5.4

#### § 4.2.2 Everyone is expected to put an equal amount of value into the project. This does not necessarily equal the amount of hours put in.

#### § 4.2.3 The general expectation for the project is a result of high value, striving for a grade of 7 to 12.


## § 5 Conflict resolution and decisions
### § 5.1 Critique
Critique and potential disagreements are to be taken in open discussion. That is as soon as a problem arises it is voiced within the group.
Critique should have the goal of being constructive and focused on the specific thing that could be improved or changed and not the person presenting the topic of critique.

### § 5.2 Ideas and suggestions
All opinions and suggestions are welcome, and should be heard. It is important that if someone is aware that the idea presented is ineffective or not useful, this should be voiced straight away. So that no time is wasted on pursuing an idea that someone else already has a solution for.

### § 5.3 Conflict resolution/handling
In case of a conflict, discussion or disagreement over a professional topic, the resolution should be sought to be a common understanding of the issue rather than a common agreement. If the conflict cannot be resolved in this way, then the solution should be decided by majority vote.
Personal conflicts should also be taken in the group, and can be voiced on the friday meetings. If someone does not feel comfortable sharing with the whole group, they can talk to Freja about it first and a solution will be found. 

### § 5.4 Deadlines
Any goals should be met within the agreed upon timeframe. Setbacks can occur and we notify the group as soon as possible. If a deadline is unreachable, the priority/scope/deadline of the tasks is realigned accordingly.

## § 6 Communication and Culture
### § 6.1 Culture
The group shall endeavor to meet the following ideals:
 - All members shall actively listen to each other at all times.
 - Criticism is welcome as long as it is:
      1. Constructive 
      2. Not taken personally 
 - All responsibilities will be met on time in an orderly fashion.
 - All members shall endeavor to understand all parts of the project.

### § 6.2 Absence
Absence is not condoned, and any absence from any member shall be communicated out to the rest of the group in suitable time with reason for absence.
