#### RTree:
The RTree is not yet done. This is still a work in progress. Though it has come quite far and has expanded to be quite large, therefore this PR is made, to reduce the differences between it and Master - as well as letting other branches work with the RTree.
The RTree is made up of RTreeNodes and RTreeLeaves.
Nodes are rectangular areas that hold other RTreeNodes.
Leaves are sub-types of Nodes, that also have a list of Drawable elements. A leaf has no descendants besides the Drawable List, which is a list of the drawables contained within the leafs area.
General traversal of the RTree is done by moving through and into RTreeNodes until you reach an RTreeLeaf, which then holds the data we are interrested in and is processed before continuing the query.

#### Rectangles:
Rectangles are made for all Drawable objects (the Drawable interface now has a getRect() method).
Rectangles are used for Querying about an objects location. They are also used in tandem with Cities to help center the text of the cities Name.
Rectangles are created at the end of parsing.

#### Debug tool:
Currently it draws a rectangle in the center of the screen and then draws all RTreeNode Rectangles inside of it. The RTree structure is due to change, so this part of the program will most likely also be changed.

#### Nearest Node On Nearest Way:
The Nearest Node is found by first finding the nearest way with some line-projection math, and then finding the nearest Node in the list of nodes from the nearest way.

### Changed
#### City RTree update
Cities now have more robust constructors, and a few aditional fields to help with the draw method.
The Draw method now centers the text, by placing it in the middle of the cities Relation/Way's rectangle, instead of at the first node of the Relation/Way's first node.
    
### Removed
- Removed functionality ([#3](/../../issues/3))

### Performance Improvements

### Feedback

### Next week
Next week we will focus on...

#### RTree TODO
redraw optimization:
The RTree is in this branch made of all drawables in our drawableMap. Therefore, this RTree can not be used for optimizing redraw times. We would need a bigger RTree of multiple RTrees for that.

UI:
Right now there is just a "find nearest way" button, which is to be replaced when we can.
