Short description of the overall release, its included features and its impact on the final product.

### Added
- Readme ([30b30b3](/../../commit/30b30b30add715789fef333577ea212acc3168ef))

####R-Tree:
The Rectangle class has been completed and has been given a test class. Currently a rectangle can; Find distance to a 
point, check whether it intercepts another rectangle, draw itself and get its information.

Rectangles are created when the end element of a way or relation is found in the OSMParser. 
Ways and Relations have their own "createRectangle" method, which iterates over its internal components to
find the minX, minY, maxX, and maxY, which is then used to create the rectangle object and save it internally in the way/relation.
