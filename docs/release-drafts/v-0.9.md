# Release v.0.9
*Released on Friday April 30th, 2021*

Short description of the overall release, its included features and its impact on the final product.

#### Astar
We now take speeds into account, which means that in calculating the cost of the best route, we prioritize fast routes. This means that we can also display the total travel time of a route, also depending on which type of transportation you choose. 

We have made UI and A* work together which means we have different icons for the different directions which get sent along with each step.

If a route cant be found we handle it by creating a deafult Step object that outputs an error message int the routeContainer.

We fixed a bug where several calls to Astar search would cause a OutOfMememory exception since we did set node parents to null after a search.

#### Minor additions
Fixed an issue where suggestions would be saved between changing tabs, and therefore not overwritten by new suggestions.
