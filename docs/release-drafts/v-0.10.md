# Release v.0.10

_Released on Friday May 7th, 2021_

#### Minor additions
Migrated the list of Tag in Member to be a single tag, this has affected things in OSMParser, MapCanvas, Edge, Relation and Way. 
We can now merge large relations, so they get filled correctly.
Move rolemap from Member to Way, as this is the only place it is required. To use for inner and outer.
