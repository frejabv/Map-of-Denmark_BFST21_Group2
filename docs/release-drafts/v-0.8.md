# Release v.#.#

_Released on Friday March 23rd, 2021_

#### Responsive UI
This week we have implemented Responsive UI to improve the performance on smaller monitors. We expect the program to look acceptable down to 500px width and 300px height after which there is not enough space on the screen for the Map and its UI components. Also this release enables support for route-descriptions.
