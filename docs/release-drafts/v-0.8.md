#### Responsive UI
This week we have implemented Responsive UI to improve the performance on smaller monitors. We expect the program to look acceptable down to 500px width and 300px height after which there is not enough space on the screen for the Map and its UI components. Also this release enables support for route-descriptions.


#### Minor additions
Search works on enter. When there are suggestions and you press enter the first one will be chosen and the fields will react as usual. That is zoom and pan to location for search, and save node id or do an A* search (not yet implemented) for the route fields.
We have moved the scaling-constant to one class to be able to change it from one single place instead of in (many) different files.

### Added
- Support for .obj saving and loading
- Route description icons
- Route description UI

- Suggestion choosing functionality on enter (#164) 

- Added support for compiling to jar files

### Changed

- Changed styling of UI Markup to improve visual design for smaller monitors.
- Moved the scaling-constant to one central place in `Model.java`

### Removed

- Removed unused color modes

### Performance Improvements

### Feedback
We would like some feedback on the representation of steps in the Astar (astar_test) branch and if it makes sense. Also does our choice of directions make sense, for example we have not included u-turns.

### Next week

Next week we will focus on...

#### AStar 
This week we have implemented transporttypes, directions and a textual description for the A star path. 

We have made an enum Transporttype which model keeps track of. This means that you can change transporttypes in the UI which affects what routes you can take, seeing as if you are in a car you will only be able to take the driveable roads. 

Directions means that in the route description we know whether the vehicle is turning left or right. This is used for the textual description. We have made a step class that holds a Direction enum, the road driven on and the distance travelled. This can then be printed in the UI.

At the same time we count a total distance and time for the route, which the UI can also access.

Next week we will work on refining this and finding bugs to make it ready for a merge into master.
