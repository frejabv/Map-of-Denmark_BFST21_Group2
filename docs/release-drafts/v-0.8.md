#### Responsive UI
This week we have implemented Responsive UI to improve the performance on smaller monitors. We expect the program to look acceptable down to 500px width and 300px height after which there is not enough space on the screen for the Map and its UI components. Also this release enables support for route-descriptions.


#### Minor additions
Search works on enter. When there are suggestions and you press enter the first one will be chosen and the fields will react as usual. That is zoom and pan to location for search, and save node id or do an A* search (not yet implemented) for the route fields.
We have moved the scaling-constant to one class to be able to change it from one single place instead of in (many) different files.
